    <p class="p">
        I have several hobbies that I enjoy in my free time. They help me relax, learn new skills, 
        and express my creativity. Below are a few of the activities I love.
    </p>

    <h2>Reading</h2>
    <p class="p">
        Reading is one of my favorite pastimes. I love getting lost in a good story,
        whether it's a thrilling mystery or an inspiring non-fiction book. Reading
        not only expands my knowledge but also helps me see the world from different perspectives.
    </p>

    <h2>Hiking</h2>
    <p class="p3">
        There's nothing quite like spending time in nature. Hiking allows me to disconnect
        from the digital world and appreciate the beauty of the outdoors. I enjoy exploring
        new trails and challenging myself with different terrains.
    </p>

    <h3>Why I Love Hiking</h3>
    <p class="p2">
        The fresh air and beautiful views are a great way to clear my mind.
        I also love the sense of accomplishment after reaching the top of a peak.
